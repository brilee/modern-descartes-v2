A Diabolically Difficult Chemistry Puzzle

In 2012, I was a mentor at the USNCO Study Camp, which prepares and selects the top students in the U.S. to send to the International Chemistry Olympiad.
I wrote a question for the final exam which only 2 of the 20 students completed.
Both students admitted to brute-forcing the system of equation in 5 unknowns.
I found it hilarious at the time that I'd stumped the entire camp with a seemingly trivial problem.
The students were not as amused!
Without further ado:

**Balance the following equation. **

$$\ce{BH4- + BF3 ->  B11H14- + BF4- + H2(g)}$$

Source: [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-328X(03)00460-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-328X(03)00460-1)

This 11-boron, 14-hydrogen species has $C_{5v}$ symmetry (dodecahedron with missing vertex), and its parent species $\ce{B11H11^2-}$ is apparently [fluxional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxional_molecule), rapidly interconverting with no one boron identifiable.
If you're wondering how I stumbled across such an obscure reaction, I decided at some point that boron was probably a simple enough element that I could learn _everything_ there was to know about boron if I'd really tried.
Boy, was I wrong!
It turns out a lot of research went into obscure borohydride species as potential [energy-dense rocket fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaborane(9)) during the Cold War.

A hint and solution for this equation comes after the spoiler break.

# Solution

The borohydride and fluoroborate species all have boron in their (+3) oxidation state, while the B11 species has a 15/11 oxidation state, which is about (+1.36) on average.
The hydrogen, on the other hand, goes from hydride at the (-1) oxidation state to hydrogen gas at the (0) oxidation state.
We'll have to find the right ratios that lead to net electron transfer balance.

In a traditional redox reaction, typically what happens is that you first insert electrons to form the correct half-reaction, and then use $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$ species to balance oxygens, hydrogens, and charges.
As a simple example, for the reduction of Cr(+6) to Cr(+3):

$$\ce{CrO4^2- -> Cr^3+}$$

$$\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- -> Cr^3+}$$

$$\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- -> Cr^3+ + 4H2O}$$

$$\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- + 8H+ -> Cr^3+ + 4H2O}$$

How do these steps apply to this problem?
This isn't an aqueous reaction - borohydrides are pyrophoric in air!
Instead of using $\ce{H+}$ to balance our charges, we'll use $\ce{H-}$.

$$\ce{11BH4- + 20e- -> B11H14- + 30H-}$$

$$\ce{2H- -> 2e- + H2}$$

Balanced reaction:

$$\ce{11BH4- -> B11H14- + 10H- + 10H2}$$

Free hydride is not in the final equation - this is where the fluoroborate species come in.
You could see the role of $\ce{BF3}$ as a hydride sponge.

$$\ce{4BF3 + 4H- -> 3BF4- + BH4-}$$

Balancing and cancelling the hydrides, the final balanced equation is

$$\ce{17BH4- + 20BF3 -> 2B11H14- + 15BF4- + 20H2}$$
