Making my startup weekly updates public
2025/7/14

In my [startup announcement](/essays/startup_vibes/) I alluded to a private mailing list. That's been going quite well and I find the weekly posting cadence to be a great way to stay accountable, take stock of my current situation, and plan out the next week of work. These weekly updates have also generated a decent amount of conversation and fortuitous connections.

I've decided to make these updates public, for several reasons:

- I've gotten feedback that these weekly updates are interesting and valuable (and therefore worth lowering my usual bar of quality to push out a larger volume of writing).
- Lots of folks who are not friends or family have asked to join the mailing list.
- I thought I would end up posting a lot of things to a friends and family audience that I wouldn't otherwise post to the internet, but actually that hasn't been the case at all.
- I would like to turn up the "fortuitous encounters" dial to see what happens.
- I'd promised to condense the weekly updates into public monthly updates, and found trying to summarize them an uninteresting use of time.

You can find these startup updates under the [Cartesian Tutor tag](/essays/tags/cartesian_tutor/), backdated to their original private posting dates.
