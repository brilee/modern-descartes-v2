# Progress update

The last two weeks, I built a test-taking interface, an automated grader, a hinting system, image support in questions/answers/solutions, and finally figured out my test-scraping workflow. The test-scraping workflow still requires me to manually screenshot/crop images from the source PDFs, as well as to Q/C the scraping to double-check that there are no transcription errors. Luckily, I've clocked that this should only take ~15 minutes per exam, so I just need to sit down for a day or two and transcribe + Q/C every single past USNCO exam.

I learned a lot from trying to automate the test-scraping workflow, even though I probably "wasted" two weeks on it, from the perspective of just accomplishing my goal. The lessons I learned are documented in [Claude as Pipeline Orchestrator](/essays/claude_pipeline/) and [Multimodal LLMs are Blind](/essays/blind_llms/).

The site updates will probably go live mid next week, after I've gotten back from my vacation this week!

No miscellaneous thoughts this week! I tried to write a section and then realized I'd written a full length essay. After polishing "Claude as Pipeline Orchestrator", I returned to this update post and tried to write a second supplemental section, and then realized I'd written another full length essay. Oops ðŸ˜… That's partly why this update got so delayed, even while I was on vacation.
